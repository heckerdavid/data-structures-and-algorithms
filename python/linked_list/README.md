## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Code Challenge 05

Node
    Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

Linked List
    Create a Linked List class

Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
The class should contain the following methods:

insert
    Arguments: value
    Returns: nothing
    Adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

includes
    Arguments: value
    Returns: Boolean
    Indicates whether that value exists as a Node’s value somewhere within the list.

to string
    Arguments: none
    Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
        "{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"

* Code Challenge 05
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

append
    arguments: new value
    adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before
    arguments: value, new value
    adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after
    arguments: value, new value
    adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
