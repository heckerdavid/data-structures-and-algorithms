# Hashtables
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

* add
    * Arguments: key, value
    * Returns: nothing
    * This method should hash the key, and add the key and value pair to the table, handling collisions as needed.
* get
    * Arguments: key
    * Returns: Value associated with that key in the table
* contains
    * Arguments: key
    * Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.
* hash
    * Arguments: key
    * Returns: Index in the collection for that key


Tests:
* Adding a key/value to your hashtable results in the value being in the data structure
* Retrieving based on a key returns the value stored
* Successfully returns null for a key that does not exist in the hashtable
* Successfully handle a collision within the hashtable
* Successfully retrieve a value from a bucket within the hashtable that has a collision
* Successfully hash a key to an in-range value
