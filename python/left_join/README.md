# Hashmap LEFT JOIN
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Write a function that LEFT JOINs two hashmaps into a single data structure.

* Write a function called left join
    * Arguments: two hash maps
    * The first parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and a synonym of the key as values.
    * The second parameter is a hashmap that has word strings as keys, and antonyms of the key as values.
    * Return: The returned data structure that holds the results is up to you. It doesnâ€™t need to exactly match the output below, so long as it achieves the LEFT JOIN logic
