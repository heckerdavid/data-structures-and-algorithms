## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Discuss Why. What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
time: O(n)
space: O(n)

I iterated over the array, it would be impossible to do this without touching each item at least once, so I just went with the first O(n) solution that came to mind.
