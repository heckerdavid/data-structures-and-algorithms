# Trees
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Node based Binary Trees

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge 15:

* Can successfully instantiate an empty tree
* Can successfully instantiate a tree with a single root node
* Can successfully add a left child and right child to a single root node
* Can successfully return a collection from a preorder traversal
* Can successfully return a collection from an inorder traversal
* Can successfully return a collection from a postorder traversal

Challenge 16:

Write the following method for the Binary Tree class:

* find maximum value
Arguments: none
Returns: number
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

Challenge 17:

* Write a function called breadth first
Arguments: tree
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered
